# AWS CLI Deep Dive ([Link to Slides](https://slides.com/gowiem/awscli-deepdive))

This repo is an accompaniment to a talk I'm giving/gave on December 2nd, 2020. It includes the demo-magic command scripts I ran, links to tools I discussed, and some of the shell tips + tricks that I've shared through out the talk.

Check out `aws_helpers.sh` for some of my personal dotfile AWS helpers.

## Talk Abstract

Come join us to take a deeper look at the AWS CLI and how you can optimize your workflow when working with this powerful tool. We wonâ€™t touch on specific AWS services or commands, but rather take a closer view into specific areas like configuration, authentication, essential supplementary tools, and some crafty shell-fu. The result will be you walking away with enhanced productivity when interacting with AWS from the command line!
